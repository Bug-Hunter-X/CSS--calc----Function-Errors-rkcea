The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior or rendering issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` in a situation where the parent element's width hasn't been defined yet. This would fail to compute correctly. Another common issue is incorrect operator precedence, which might lead to unintended calculations.  Mixing units without proper conversion also generates errors. Example: `width: calc(50% + 2em)` can cause unpredictable results unless the units are consistent or conversions are handled explicitly.
