# CSS `calc()` Function Errors

This repository demonstrates common and uncommon errors encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `bug.css` file showcases these errors, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected versions.  The issues addressed include:

* **Incorrect Usage:** Using `calc()` where the required dimensions aren't yet set.
* **Operator Precedence:** Incorrect order of operations, leading to wrong calculations.
* **Unit Mixing:** Combining incompatible units (e.g., `px` and `%`) without proper conversion.

Understanding these potential pitfalls is critical for writing robust and predictable CSS styles.
